## Today City Places

This Single Page Application lets you bookmark your favourite places on a map adding extra data such as description. The user can log-in to their own account and keep their bookmarked places private.<br>

This was useful for me to get familiar with how map libraries work.

<em>Stack: React, Redux, TypeScript, Styled-Components, MongoDB, Leaflet.</em>
